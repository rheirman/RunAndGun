		<content>RunAndGun has been updated with the following changes: 
- The RunAndGun movement penalty now depends on how heavy weapons are. What are considered heavy weapons and the penalty per weapon type can be configured in the mod options. 
- Added a mod option that can be used to set the chance that enemy pawns will use RunAndGun while fleeing. 
- Improved compatibility with non-human races. 
- Changed the position of the RunAndGun button.

		<assemblyVersion>1.18.3</assemblyVersion>
		<content>RunAndGun has been updated with the following changes: 
- Weapon selector for forbidding and in the mod settings has been completely re-implemented to a more user-friendly design. 
- When mods that add new weapons are installed, the weight filter is applied automatically so new weapons are generally configured well from now on. 
- Unfortunately, anything configured in the previous version of the weapon selector has to be re-configured.

RunAndGun has been updated to support Rimworld version 1.1 (including the expansion). Credits for this update go to Ogliss. Thanks to this amazing community my mods are being kept alive!
This version also supports Rimworld 1.0, so no need to worry if you're still using that version.
